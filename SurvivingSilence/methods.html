        <p><a href="data.html">The Daily Pennsylvanian poll</a> on sexual violence at the University was conducted from Sept. 23, 2013 to Oct. 2, 2013. An invitation to participate in the online poll was emailed to a random panel of 2,867 undergraduates at their Penn email address. Of those, 974 responded to the poll, for a response rate of 33.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The response rate to this poll was very high as compared even to “gold standard” polls — telephone surveys conducted by firms like Gallup — that commonly have a response rate of under 15 percent.</p>
        <p>The poll was completely anonymous; no identifying information, including name, email address or IP address, was collected when respondents completed the poll.</p>
        <p>Respondents were told that if they completed the poll, they would have the opportunity to enter to win a gift card to one of two campus restaurants.</p>
        <p>The percentages reported by the DP are raw and unweighted.</p>
        <p>The margin of sampling error indicates how confident one can be that the responses obtained in the survey sample reflect the responses that one would obtain if the entire population — in this case, all undergraduates — had responded to the survey. The margin of error was calculated assuming a binomial distribution with a 50 percent split at the 95 percent confidence level.</p>
        <p>For responses that include the entire sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.41 percentage points, meaning that one can be 95 percent confident that the true value of any given response for the entire population of undergraduates lies within 3.41 percentage points of the value obtained in the poll. For responses of just men, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5.78 percentage points; for just women, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.38 percentage points. For responses of people who know a victim of sexual assault at Penn, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 6.24 percentage points. For responses of people who said they were in a fraternity or sorority, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 6.97 percentage points.</p>
        <p>The demographic makeup of the sample is similar to that of the population of undergraduates at Penn along most dimensions, including proportion of students in a fraternity or sorority, proportion of students living in college houses and race. In contrast, women represented a disproportionately high portion of the sample — 61 percent, compared to 50 percent of all undergraduates.</p>
        <p>As with all surveys, error can be introduced in a number of ways. Of particular interest is response bias. It might be expected that people who know more about sexual assault or have been affected by sexual assault are more likely to respond to an invitation to participate in a poll on that topic. However, the substantive findings — particularly that respondents were under-informed on campus resources — could suggest that effect is small. The incentive offered to complete the poll was also meant to mitigate response bias. Possible error could also be caused by the order the questions were presented in. Response options were randomized when possible to ensure the order responses were listed did not contribute to the results.</p>
