      <p>In October 2012, Angie Epifano wrote a harrowing account of being sexually assaulted by a classmate while she was a student at Amherst College. Epifano, who told the college what had happened, wrote in Amherst’s student newspaper of how her report had been disregarded by campus officials.</p>

      <p>Her account soon became a rallying cry for college students across the country. Over the past year, as the Department of Education has shown greater interest in investigating how colleges respond to cases of sexual violence, dozens of students like Epifano have spoken out.</p>

      <p>Students at institutions like Dartmouth College, Swarthmore College and the University of Southern California have filed complaints with the Education Department, alleging mishandling of sexual misconduct cases. Some of those complaints center on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bars sex discrimination at institutions that receive federal support; others revolve around the Clery Act, a federal law requiring institutions to provide accurate data on campus crime.</p>

      <p>At institutions that have seen growing student activist movements, the take-home message has been the same: How higher education handles sexual violence is in desperate need of reform, and colleges need to be at the forefront of the push for change. </p>

      <h3>Amherst College</h3>

      <p>In January, Amherst released a report on sexual violence that stemmed from Epifano’s rape account in October, which for months had rocked the small Massachusetts college. The report, while arguing that Amherst had never swept the problem of sexual assault under the rug, said the college’s handling of individual cases had often been inadequate. </p>

      <p>Carolyn “Biddy” Martin, Amherst’s president, has been unusually frank and forward for a campus leader in acknowledging the college’s shortcomings. Praising Epifano’s courage, Martin said last October that the student’s account had created an opportunity for a campus-wide discussion on sexual violence, “for which I am very grateful.”</p>

      <p>The January report recommended, among other things, that the college needed to do a better job of integrating freshmen, especially women, into campus life; that it needed to revisit its alcohol policies, particularly as they related to sexual violence; and that it needed better coordination and communication within its student affairs offices, particularly at its counseling center.</p>

      <p>Amherst has started to implement several of the recommendations made in the report. For example, at the college, trained investigators are now required to meet with students who report or are accused of sexual violence.</p>

      <p>Epifano’s account last year was the catalyst behind others at Amherst, as well as students throughout higher education, speaking out about sexual violence. </p>

      <h3>Dartmouth College, Swarthmore College, University of California at Berkeley </h3>

      <p>Students at Dartmouth, Swarthmore and Berkeley, as well as the University of Southern California, announced on the same day in May that they had filed complaints with the Education Department over their institutions’ alleged mishandling of sexual assault. Some of the complaints allege violations of the Clery Act; others were filed under Title IX.</p>

      <p>This recent round of federal complaints — coming at an elite Ivy League institution, a top liberal arts college and a crown jewel of the nation’s public higher-education system — was among the most significant to date. The students announced the complaints at a joint press conference in New York alongside Gloria Allred, a high-profile attorney who is advising students at several institutions in sexual violence cases.</p>

      <p>Following the federal filings, some of the student complainants have claimed that their institutions have retaliated against them. At Swarthmore, for example, Mia Ferguson, one of the students who complained to the Education Department, said the college had retaliated by not allowing her to become a resident adviser in a campus dormitory. Colleges officials denied those charges, saying that Ferguson was unemployable because she had refused to provide police with the identity of a victim of an alleged rape in a separate case.</p>

      <p>At Dartmouth, several students who had filed a Clery Act complaint were informed in May that the college had charged them with violating its student code of conduct for participating in an April protest over the handling of sexual assault on campus. The students have said they believe the charges are a direct response to the federal complaint; Dartmouth denies that it is retaliating. </p>

      <h3>Yale University</h3>

      <p>Outrage over Yale’s handling of sexual assault came to a boil over the summer, when the New Haven institution released a report saying that some students who had been found guilty of “nonconsensual sex” had been allowed to remain enrolled at the university. In some cases, the report said, those students were punished with a mere slap on the wrist — facing either a written reprimand or a short-term suspension.</p>

      <p>Yale’s handling of sexual assault and harassment, which was the subject of a federal investigation in 2011, has faced harsh criticism over the past year. Months before the summer report, the Education Department slapped the university with a $165,000 fine for failing to disclose several forcible sex offenses that took place more than a decade ago. </p>

      <p>While more than 10 institutions have been fined over the past decade for violations of the Clery Act, Yale’s fine was one of the largest ever assessed to a university.</p>

      <p>Earlier this semester, in an attempt to clear up confusion over the summer report, Yale released a set of hypothetical scenarios that described consensual and nonconsensual sex. The scenarios, released in a September campus-wide email, detailed three hypothetical cases in which nonconsensual sex would result in expulsion. </p>

      <h3>Occidental College, University of Southern California</h3>

      <p>Occidental and USC, two Los Angeles institutions, admitted in October that they have not reported a number of sex crimes in recent years. The admissions add fuel to the fire of federal investigations that both institutions are facing for their alleged mishandling of sexual misconduct cases.</p>

      <p>Occidental said that it had failed to report 24 alleged sex crimes that took place between 2010 and 2011 in its annual Clery reports; USC said it had failed to report 13 offenses during that same time. Occidental had hired an independent security consultant to review its reporting data; USC’s findings were the result of a self-initiated internal review.</p>

      <p>Both institutions attributed the underreporting to mishandling of cases that involved anonymous complaints.</p>

      <p>Several weeks earlier, Occidental announced that it had settled a lawsuit with students who accused the college of improperly handling cases of sexual assault on campus. The lawsuit, which was filed in the spring in conjunction with two federal complaints against Occidental, settled on undisclosed terms.</p>

      <p>The Occidental complaints have had several unusual effects on the college’s administration. In the spring, Occidental faculty passed a “no-confidence” vote in Carl Botterud, the college’s general counsel, for his role in sexual misconduct cases. Votes of no confidence are generally reserved for upper-level administrators — presidents, provosts and, in rare cases, deans.
      
      <h3>University of North Carolina</h3>

      <p>UNC is currently facing three separate federal investigations into its handling of sexual assault. The most recent investigation, announced by the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights over the summer, is looking into whether UNC retaliated against Landen Gambill, a student who was accused by the university’s honor court of “intimidating” an ex-boyfriend who she claims sexually assaulted her.</p>

      <p>Gambill had previously filed a federal complaint in March, claiming that UNC officials had twice retaliated against her — the first time by assigning her ex-boyfriend to a residence hall near her own, the second by allowing the honor court to file charges against her.</p>

      <p>UNC, like a handful of peer institutions facing similar sexual assault probes, has experienced several leadership changes over the past year. Carol Folt, previously interim president at Dartmouth, began serving as chancellor of UNC in July, succeeding Holden Thorp. Presidents and chancellors who are brought in amidst federal investigations into their institutions’ handling of sexual assault often face a difficult balancing act; on one hand, they are looking to build favor across campus by starting a discussion on sexual violence, but are at the same time limited in what they can say publicly because of the legal issues surrounding assault.</p>

      <p>A recently formed UNC task force on sexual assault is continuing to recommend changes to university policy.</p>
