<p>Graphs are a difficult data structure to represent in a natural and usable way. In particular, deriving a definition such that its equality matches that of graph equality is quite challenging on its own, let alone a definition that additionally permits induction over the number of vertices and edges. However, assume there is a type for (finite) sets that allows for induction over their size. Then, given some (finite) set <code>V</code>, a (finite) graph over the set <code>V</code> can be defined as the set <code>V × E</code>, where <code>E ⊆ V × V</code>. This both matches the formulation used in mathematics, and would have the desired properties described previously. Thus, we conclude with the following question: “How does one define such a formulation of sets?”</p>
